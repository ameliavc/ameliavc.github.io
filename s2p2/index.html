    <div class="text" id="first"><p>A storyteller’s job is about more than simply telling a story. Sure, it’s about entertaining, but it’s also about remembering the <id class="kudos">past</id>, teaching the present, and protecting the future. Lana Knowles, in charge of all the storytellers in the collective, knows this. She knows this, yet, as she searches the shelves, hands shaking while she looks for answers, she still asks herself how she got here, how it became her lot to bear the responsibility of the <id class="word">past.</id></p></div>

    <div class="text" id="second"><p>Lana has been compiling her library since she was old enough to read, using gifts and scraps borrowed from her parents, who had themselves been storytellers. In her almost 50 years of searching, she had amassed quite an impressive collection. It had answers to any question, if one could find the right source. The collection was somewhat organized, the books on the left side of the room, the artifacts and such on the other, but finding anything specific would prove challenging. Occasionally she tried cleaning it up, tidying the shelves and organizing things according to their subject matter, but organization never stuck very long in her life. In under a week, she would look around and realize that she was back where she had started, books haphazardly stacked around the room, grimoires next to anthologies of wars long past.</p></div>
    <input type="checkbox" id="story3"><label for="story3" id="old"><img src="amphora.png" alt="photo of a greek vase with figures running"></label><br>
    <div class="text" id="third"><p>She scans the shelves, steady grey eyes and inkstained hands trailing over spines, skimming over titles. She can’t reach the top shelves, so she pulls a chair over and steps up, wobbling as she views the parts of her collection that she so rarely has to use. Her shoulders slump and her breath whooshes out as she realizes that she won’t find the answer.</p></div>
    <input type="checkbox" id="final"><label for="final" id="yum"><img src="plate-of-cookies.png" alt="cartoon style blue plate with a variety of chocolate and chocolate chip cookies"></label><br>
    <div class="text" id="last"><p>From the hall comes a clamor of footsteps and excited voices belonging to the children she would see that day. Slowly, she steps down from the chair and navigates towards the door, checking that the couches were set up, the fire high, and the plate of cookies overflowing.</p></div>

    <div class="background"><p>In the time before the Remaking, when monsters roamed, there were many types of monsters. The most powerful were the ones that could blend in with humans. If they looked like humans, they could get closer to humans, and it’s easier to kill prey that trusts you. Many monsters, even those that didn’t look like humans, had magic. Some could teleport, others could manipulate materials, and others could shapeshift. Still, not all of the monsters had magic. Some of them were human. The monsters without magic had chosen power over their community, and it showed in their appearance. The effect of their choice looked different on everyone, but it always appeared.</p></div>
    <div class="background"><p>These changes were all unnatural, hair that was made of live snakes, tattoos that moved of their own accord, and animalistic features like tails or ears on the tops of their heads. It was easy to tell who had forsaken their humanity. Before the world was Remade, there were checkpoints at every gate into the city, looking for any signs of visitors being monsters.</p></div>
