    Are there other metaphors for the sites that were saved?<br> Also, what other things can use the same metaphor of the ruins or the walled garden?<br> I can't remember what is supposed to be in this response, but I thought that the article was very interesting. I was sad that some of the links that we were directed to no longer work-though that does add to some of her commentary about planning for the future and how she referenced that some things don't work at later dates. It also made me notice that all of her sources had the "date accessed", which also added to the idea that something so crucial for a website/article being published right now, may no longer be relevant or usable when the same content is being viewed later. I feel like this is enough, but I'll add one more question.<br> How does the internet archive way-back machine(not sure if this is the right name) decide what websites to store?

    <article class="headers">Week 5</article><br>I'm not sure when this was written, but has there been any new advancements beyond QR codes that could be considered a blend of traditional and e-publication? 
<br>
I found this very interesting as someone who, while I've never made a book, has attended lectures on how to make them. I like the list at the end of the similarities/comparability of print and electronics. The analogy of hardcover = paid access and paperback = free access was intriguing because it feels more like different levels of subscriptions.
<br>
Are retellings or fanfiction similar to what the first author was speaking when he mentioned "sampling" previous works?

    <div class="week 7">
    <article class="headers">Week 7</article><br>>I liked their point about the authorship of alt-text. Beyond just adding context for who wrote the description, it acknowledges who took the time to add this accessibility feature. With the thought of alt-text as its own unique piece of art signing it tells the audience who the artist is. I found it interesting how many times they introduced an idea and then said, "that's not what we're talking about here, though".
<br>
This may be an uneducated statement, but it seems like alt-text is pretty simple to add, so why does this article make it sound like a monumental task that takes quite a bit of resources?
<br>
Why do people care if the description of an image is objective vs subjective?
<br>
****Is "dealth valley" a typo?

    <div class="week 8">
    <article class="headers">Week 8</article><br>This was a very interesting article because it introduced a problem, then offered a potential solution, only to tell us that the problem is unsolvable unless the entire basis for modern code is reset. I feel that it is very unlikely that a reset will become overwhelmingly popular due to the reasons the author listed, most importantly that anything made before the reset would have to be remade or be lost from the "new world". Another factor that I believe makes any universal code more difficult is how many languages have words and concepts that don't translate to any others. To be able to have Japanese code interact with Arabic code, there would have to be some sort of translation somewhere, meaning that things will be lost or mistranslated.
<br>
Is it possible that someone who doesn't know English could use a dictionary/translator book to allow them to code in an unfamiliar language?
<br>
If Asia doesn't like unicode(which, from the article, sounds valid) what do they use as a basis to program their websites?-this extends to every non-latin language, how do they input text in a program if the programs don't know how to interpret the characters?

    <div class="week 9">
    <article class="headers">Week 9</article><br>This article was especially interesting to me because I was recently learning about Gestalt and the phi phenomenon in psych. I didn't understand the purpose of the run-on sentence, partially because the big chunk of text was harder to read, but thought it was funny that the artist pestered scientists with his buttons, provoking NASA to release the images of Earth.
<br>
Why don't we use more of the loading symbols-seeing the different options/iterations it went through, there is more we could do with them.
<br>
Rand's designs don't seem particularly complicated or difficult, what made him such a famous designer?

    <div class="week 10">
    <article class="headers">Week 10</article><br>I feel like the author was trying a little too hard to sound smart. He kept using big words in unnecessary places and would use too many, when one, simpler word would also get the point across. This made it much more difficult to read and parse out what he was trying to say under all the floof. There is a lot more to the history and symbolism of mickey mouse, and it's interesting that it is now more or less a symbol for capitalism.
<br>
What connections can be made between postmodernist architecture and postmodernist web design?
<br>
What other signifiers have impacts as large as mickey mouse?
